# RadegastGame
How the game works: 
Given an initial terrain (an MxN matrix) in an input file, with each entry representing the initial height of that coordinate, the user places a total number of 10 stones to the wished coordinate. Placing a stone to a coordinate increases the height by 1. After all the stones are placed, the terrain is flooded with money lake and the program finally prints out the terrain where connected money puddles are labeled with the same algebraic string notation and a final score calculated by the sum of the square roots of the volumes of each puddle.
